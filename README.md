# Recipe Generator
The Recipe Generator is a web application that helps users discover random recipes based on their preferred cuisine and dietary restrictions. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability. Users can select a cuisine (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Indian) and dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) to generate a recipe with details like title, preparation time, ingredients, and instructions.
Features

# Customizable Preferences: Choose cuisine and dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
# Random Recipe Generation: Generates a random recipe from a predefined dataset based on user input.
# Responsive Design: Clean, mobile-friendly interface with a modern look.
# Error Handling: Displays a message if no recipes match the user's criteria.
# Modular Architecture: Organized into five modules for better code maintainability.

# Technologies Used

# HTML5: For the structure of the web application.
# CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
# JavaScript (ES6 Modules): For interactivity, data management, and DOM manipulation.

# Installation
To run the Recipe Generator locally, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/kaya-khurana/recipe-generator.git


# Navigate to the Project Directory:cd recipe-generator


# Open the Application:
Option 1: Open index.html directly in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Option 2: Serve the project using a local server for proper ES6 module support:npm install -g live-server
